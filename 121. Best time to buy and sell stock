If you have to sell stock on ith day, then you have to buy it from 0 to i-1 day on the minimum value, for maximum profit.
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int minimum = prices[0];
        int profit = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i<prices.size(); i++){
            int cost = prices[i]-minimum;
            profit = max(profit, cost);
            minimum = min(minimum, prices[i]);
        }
        return profit;
    }
};
